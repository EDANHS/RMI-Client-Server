# Code execution
Import project to Eclipse and run RunServer as a Java application, then do the same with RunClient.

## Existing features
1. **RunClient**: Offers a menu where you can create, search or display a person saved on the server. To finish executing the client, select the corresponding option.
2. **RunServer**: Provides a menu to create and display personas. To finish the execution, select the option and the server will disconnect automatically.
3. *Client* and *Server* are synchronized, so if a client saves a person, this will be reflected on the server.
